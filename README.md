# Regression-models

Application of supervised Regression models

Exploring relationship between model complexities and generalization performance, by adjusting key parameters of the models.

Application content:
- inserting random data
- visualization of the data
- polynomial LinearRegression models on training data for function degrees 1,3,6,9
- visualization of the predicted models
- regression scores for the predicted models
- graphical presentation of the regression scores
- regression scores for a non-regularized LinearRegression model and a lasso regression model
